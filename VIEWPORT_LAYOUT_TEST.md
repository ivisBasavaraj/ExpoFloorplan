# Viewport Layout Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Full Viewport Usage
- Removed Layout wrapper from FloorPlanEditor routes in App.tsx
- Changed FloorPlanEditor container to use `fixed inset-0` for full viewport
- Added global CSS to prevent scrollbars on html, body, and #root

### 2. Responsive Canvas
- Updated Canvas component to use container dimensions instead of window dimensions
- Added ResizeObserver to track container size changes
- Changed Stage width/height to use containerSize state

### 3. CSS Grid Layout
- Replaced flexbox with CSS Grid for main content area
- Used `grid-cols-[256px_1fr_256px]` for desktop layout
- Added responsive breakpoints for mobile (single column)

### 4. Overflow Prevention
- Added `overflow: hidden` to all containers
- Used `min-h-0` and `min-w-0` for proper grid behavior
- Added touch-action: none for canvas area

## Test Instructions

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/admin/floor-plans/new`
2. Verify no scrollbars appear in browser
3. Check that canvas fills entire available space
4. Test window resizing - canvas should adapt
5. Test on mobile/tablet - sidebars should hide on small screens
6. Verify drawing tools and panels work properly

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Page occupies entire browser viewport
- ✅ No horizontal or vertical scrollbars
- ✅ Canvas is responsive and fits screen width/height
- ✅ Drawing tools and side panels adjust properly
- ✅ Layout doesn't break on window resize
- ✅ Mobile responsive (sidebars hidden on small screens)
