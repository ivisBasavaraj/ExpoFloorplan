# Viewer Mode Restrictions - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Booth Count Display Issues ✅
**Problem**: Recent Floor Plans table showed incorrect booth counts
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced booth count display with detailed breakdown
- Added available/reserved counts alongside sold/total
- Improved visual progress bars
- Added debugging to track data flow

### 2. Preview/Edit Links Loading Wrong Floor Plans ✅
**Problem**: Clicking Preview/Edit links loaded incorrect floor plans
**Root Cause**: Viewer was using public API (published only) while dashboard shows all plans (including drafts)
**Solution**:
- Modified `EnhancedUserFloorPlanViewer` to use authenticated API when user is logged in
- Added proper floor plan ID matching and loading
- Enhanced error handling and debugging

### 3. Viewer Mode Security - Prevent Editing ✅
**Problem**: Users could modify booth positions and floor plan elements in viewer mode
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive editing restrictions in `ElementRenderer.tsx`:

#### Dragging Restrictions:
- `draggable={viewerMode === 'editor'}` - Only allow dragging in editor mode
- Enhanced `handleDragStart()` to block drag operations in viewer mode
- Proper event cancellation to prevent unintended interactions

#### Transformation Restrictions:
- Transformers only show in editor mode: `{isSelected && viewerMode === 'editor' && <Transformer...>`
- Transformer attachment only in editor mode
- No resize handles, rotation handles, or anchor points in viewer mode

#### UI Element Restrictions:
- Delete buttons hidden in viewer mode: `{viewerMode === 'editor' && renderDeleteButton()}`
- Selection behavior modified for viewer mode
- Visual cursor changes: pointer for booths, default for other elements

#### Click Behavior:
- In viewer mode: Only booth clicks allowed (for information display)
- In viewer mode: Non-booth elements ignore clicks completely
- In editor mode: Normal selection and editing behavior

## Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test_dashboard_fixes.py` - Verifies API data flow and access controls
- `test_viewer_restrictions.py` - Validates security restrictions

## User Experience

### For Viewers (Public/Non-Admin Users):
- Can view published floor plans only
- Can click booths to see company information
- Cannot modify any floor plan elements
- Clear visual feedback on interactive elements

### For Admins:
- Can view all floor plans (including drafts)
- Full editing capabilities in editor mode
- Preview mode respects same restrictions as public viewers
- Dashboard shows accurate booth statistics

## Verification Steps

1. **Dashboard**: Check that booth counts match backend data
2. **Preview Links**: Verify correct floor plan loads when clicking Preview/Edit
3. **Viewer Mode**: Confirm no elements can be dragged or modified
4. **Booth Clicks**: Ensure booth information popups work correctly
5. **API Security**: Verify draft plans are protected from public access

## Result

The floor plan viewer now provides a secure, read-only experience where users can:
- View floor plans and booth layouts
- Get information about exhibitors and booths
- Navigate and explore the floor plan
- **Cannot modify, move, or edit any elements**

All editing capabilities are properly restricted to editor mode only, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications.
